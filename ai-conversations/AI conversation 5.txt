ME" This is the current code to my UI, what improvements can you suggest

def parse_weather_question(question):
    try:
        # Assuming get_response can take a system message and user message
        response = get_response(prompt)
        # Attempt to parse the response as JSON
        import json
        parsed_data = json.loads(response)
        return parsed_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing weather question: {e}")
        return None


Nice â€” youâ€™re clearly setting up a chat-based UI layer that calls some model (via get_response) and parses a weather-related question into structured JSON data.

However, this function is quite minimal right now, and there are several ways to make it safer, clearer, and more flexible â€” both technically and from a UX perspective.

Letâ€™s walk through the main improvements ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ§  Current issues / limitations

prompt isnâ€™t defined â€” so this function as written will raise a NameError.
You probably meant to use question instead or construct a full prompt message.

get_response return type is unclear â€” if itâ€™s from a model like GPT, the response might contain text that isnâ€™t valid JSON (e.g., extra formatting, code fences, or explanations).

Error handling is too generic â€” youâ€™re catching all exceptions, but you could separate JSON parsing errors vs. model errors.

No validation on parsed JSON â€” you assume the response structure is valid.

No logging or visibility â€” print() is okay for debugging but not ideal for production.

Docstring / typing missing â€” helps readability and avoids silent errors.

Improved version

Hereâ€™s a safer, more maintainable version with good practices built in:

import json
import logging

def parse_weather_question(question: str) -> dict | None:
    """
    Sends a natural language weather question to a model and parses
    the structured response (expected in JSON format).

    Args:
        question (str): The user's weather-related question.

    Returns:
        dict | None: Parsed JSON data from the model's response, or None if parsing fails.
    """
    try:
        # Build a well-structured system + user prompt
        system_message = (
            "You are a weather assistant. "
            "Given a user question, return a structured JSON object with keys like "
            "'location', 'date', and 'information_type' (e.g., temperature, forecast, humidity). "
            "Return only valid JSON with no extra text."
        )

        # Combine into a single input if your get_response function accepts plain text
        prompt = f"{system_message}\n\nUser question: {question}"

        response = get_response(prompt)  # Assuming this returns a string

        # Optional: strip out code fences if the model includes them
        response = response.strip().removeprefix("```json").removesuffix("```").strip()

        try:
            parsed_data = json.loads(response)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            logging.warning(f"Model response not valid JSON: {response[:200]}...")
            return None

        # Validate structure
        expected_keys = {"location", "date", "information_type"}
        if not any(key in parsed_data for key in expected_keys):
            logging.warning("Parsed data missing expected keys.")
            return None

        return parsed_data

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error parsing weather question: {e}", exc_info=True)
        return None
