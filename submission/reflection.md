# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
The AI tools used for the project were mainly ChatGPT to review and improve existing code and Gemini to diagnose errors when running the code in Colab. Ollama was used as well for through HANDS_ON_AI_SERVER and HANDS_ON_AI_MODEL for natural language processing. 

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I found that the way a question/prompt is asked makes a massive difference in the answer that is outputted. Vague questions often led to answers were unrelated to the code that I had, with heavy changes to the formatting and structure. Asking concise questions with a list of points acting as constraints worked best in my approach. 

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
The code itself works which was a pleasant surprise, the UI contains a small menu with 3 options and one to exit out. It is possible to get visual examples of the weather data as well as text overviews for weather and precipitation. A major lesson that I learned in this project was on API keys and how important it is to not keep them in the code directly. I initially changed the “s.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_API_KEY'] =” so that it would always contain my Ollama key, both ChatGPT and Gemini suggested that this was a bad approach. 

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
I would have started this project significantly earlier and put more effort into reading the instructions. There was a lot of information that I missed because of this mistake and could potentially have made my life easier and the project better. I would also have committed more frequently to GitHub as I had to look for ages to find a portion of code that I had accidentally removed. Further I would need better understanding in where my code was going wrong  when using improved code from my AI tools. 

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
I would say that it was a good assignment idea and there is very liberal use of AI which should make it easier. I have a better understanding of how to prompt better as a result of this project.
